Question 1
A vector is a:

1 / 1 point

Location in space


A displacement in space

Correct
Yes. A vector conveys both direction and magnitude.

2.
Question 2
A transform contains all of the following, EXCEPT?

1 / 1 point

Mass


Scale


Rotation


Position

Correct
That is correct. A transform does not contain mass. A transform contains position, rotation, and scale.

3.
Question 3
The transform for a (child) gameObject that has a parent, shows its position relative to:

1 / 1 point

The parent gameObject’s origin


The child gameObject’s origin


The world origin

Correct
Correct! A child's transform information is shown relative to it's parent gameObject.

4.
Question 4
What colors (in order) are X, Y, and Z-axes represented as typically?

1 / 1 point

Red, Green, Blue


Blue, Red, Green


White, Black, Grey


Purple, Yellow, Orange

Correct
Correct. Remember the the phrase XYZ = RGB!

5.
Question 5
The coordinate system in Unity is measured in:

1 / 1 point

Meters


Centimeters


Inches


Feet

Correct
Yes. 1 unit = 1 meter in Unity's coordinate system.

6.
Question 6
What is a quick way to move a gameObject back to the origin of its parent (or the world if no parent)?

1 / 1 point

Move the gameObject in the game view.


Delete the gameObject and recreate it.


Reset the transform component in the inspector.

Correct
Correct!  Resetting the transform component on the gameObject will move the gameObject to the world origin (0,0,0).  It will also set the rotation to (0,0,0) and the scale to (1,1,1).

7.
Question 7
Where is the origin in a typical 2D bitmap graphic?

1 / 1 point

Center


B​ottom-Right Corner


T​op-Left Corner

Correct
T​hat is correct! 2D bitmaps typically has the origin in the top-left corner by default.

8.
Question 8
Where is the origin in a typical 2D cartesian coordinate system?

1 / 1 point

T​op-Left Corner


Center


B​ottom-Right Corner

Correct
T​hat is correct! Cartesian coordinate systems, be they 2D or 3D, have the origin at the center of the world.
