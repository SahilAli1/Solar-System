Question 1
What component is like a microphone in the game world?

1 / 1 point

Audio Source


Audio Listener

Correct
That is correct. The audio listener component is what picks up sound in 3D space. There can be only one audio listener active at one time. Audio listeners can be on any gameObject but are typically on the main camera.

T​rue


F​alse

Correct
Correct. You want the music to maintain a constant distance from the audio listener, so it is typically best to attach it to the gameObject that has the active audio listener. The main camera has an audio listener component by default, so this is a great place to add an audio source that plays the game music.
